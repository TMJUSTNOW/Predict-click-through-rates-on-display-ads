Predict-click-through-rates-on-display-ads
==========================================

Display advertising is a billion dollar effort and one of the central uses of machine learning on the Internet. However, its data and methods are usually kept under lock and key. In this research competition, CriteoLabs is sharing a weekâ€™s worth of data for you to develop models predicting ad click-through rate (CTR). Given a user and the page he is visiting, what is the probability that he will click on a given ad? The goal of this challenge is to benchmark the most accurate ML algorithms for CTR estimation. All winning models will be released under an open source license. As a participant, you are given a chance to access the traffic logs from Criteo that include various undisclosed features along with the click labels.
